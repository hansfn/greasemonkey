============

Collection of (hacky, badly written) GreaseMonkey scripts.

## Fronter Portfolio Filter

For users of the LMS [Fronter](http://com.fronter.info/).

The script adds filtering of the result matrix in the Portfolio tool:

* Show only users with all exercises approved.
* Show only users with some exercises not-approved (or missing).
* Hide results - only display names.

The filters are available as "User Script Commands" in the GreaseMonkey menu.

[Install the user script](https://github.com/hansfn/greasemonkey/raw/master/fronter-portfolio-filter.user.js)
or [view a demonstration (in Norwegian)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVFqL8UpkTQ).
